## Notes

**Project stage**: Growing collaboration - expect stakeholder base to expand as universities and other partners join.

**Multi-dimensional deliverables**: This project requires parallel work across curriculum design, partnership development, marketing, and operational infrastructure. Use TodoWrite to track progress across these different work streams.

**Interdisciplinary nature**: Content likely spans multiple domains - leverage RAG collections (especially readwise, moire_strategy) for cross-domain insights and frameworks.
