# "Make It So" Camp
## How to Become a Captain of AI (instead of being driven by it)

A strategist opens Claude Code at 9am, hoping today is the day it finally clicks.

She's read the tutorials. Watched the demos. She knows this tool could transform her work. But every session ends the same way: promising starts that drift into confusion. Not because she lacks the brains—because she can't figure out how to get what she wants out of her head and into the machine in a way which gets what she wants.

She's not alone. Across industries, knowledge workers are experimenting in isolation.

Researchers, analysts, project managers, operations leads—each running private experiments with AI tools. Some are succeeding quietly. Most are struggling silently. There is no shared vocabulary. No pattern library. No moment where anyone says "here's what I'm learning" in a way which makes sense to people who aren't coding. The tools are spreading faster than the knowledge of how to use them.

Here's what's strange: the people who succeed aren't the most technical. When Anthropic released Claude Code, developers used it for coding—then quickly began directing it to do everything else. The shift wasn't about programming skills. It was about something harder to name.

Developers became "directors" because they already had the habit of specifying their intent. Years of writing code trained them to articulate goals, constraints, and success criteria with brutal precision. Not because code requires technical knowledge—but because code requires clarity. The machine doesn't guess. You have to say exactly what you mean.

This highlights a gap. The gap isn't technical documentation or tutorials—those exist in abundance. YouTube overflows with "how to use AI" videos. Every tool has a getting-started guide. The knowledge workers who struggle aren't missing information. They're missing something else.

The gap is about articulation: your ability to specify exactly what you actually want done. Not the technical syntax. The underlying skill of making implicit methods explicit. This means defining success criteria, naming constraints, directing the drafts, giving targeted feedback, and evaluating the results. It's about translating years of tacit expertise into something precise enough that both humans and machines can understand, execute on, and evaluate.

## Articulation is Your Superpower, or "Why I'm Glad a Got a Liberal Arts Degree After All"

You cannot delegate to a machine what you cannot articulate. This is your bottleneck. It's not processing power, not which model you're using, not which language you speak.

The limiting factor is your ability to say—precisely—what you want, why you want it, how close the output is to it, and how you'll know when it's done.

Here's what articulation looks like in practice:

**Vague**: "Help me analyze our customer data and find insights."

Result: Generic observations. Obvious patterns. Nothing actionable.

Compare that to this:

**Articulated**: "Identify customers who purchased twice in Q1 but not Q2. Segment by acquisition channel. Flag any segment with 40% drop-off. Output as a ranked list with a hypothesis for why each segment is dropping off."

Result: Three segments flagged. One hypothesis led to a $50K campaign fix.

Most knowledge workers have never been trained like this. We've never had to make our methods explicit, or our goals so clear, until now. Our expertise lives in our intuition, pattern recognition, judgment calls and inarticulate feelings, often made in milliseconds. That's fine when you're working alone. But when you delegate to an AI, you need words for what you know.

You've tried the tools. You've hit the wall. You sense something is shifting, but you're not sure how to ride the wave. If your work is going well without AI, this may not be for you yet. But if you sense this shift underway—and want to lead it rather than follow—then this is for you. That instinct is worth trusting.

## The Difference, in Detail

You're not becoming a coder. You're becoming a captain; a director of activity, a shaper of intent, an evaluator of outcomes.

Captains don't row boats. Film directors don't operate cameras. Writing room showrunners don't write every line.

They set the vision, oversee the process, give precise feedback, guide the outcome and ensure coherence across work done by many others. That's your job now. That is all of our jobs. This is the differentiator; from technical ability to creative direction.

When technical ability becomes less important (because AI is doing the work), articulation becomes essential. What matters most is creative vision. Precise feedback. Clear success criteria. The ability to specify goals and constraints so exactly that execution becomes straightforward—whether the executor is human or machine.

## What is Next?

"Make It So" Camp is a one week intensive. It's a place where we'll build working solutions to real problems from your own practice, share insights on what works and what doesn't, Document methodologies and connect with people just like you exploring the same frontier.

This isn't for those waiting for a playbook. If you'd rather follow corporate best practices than shape them, wait. Someone will write the manual eventually. This is for practitioners who want to define how their work evolves—while the tools are still malleable and the ecosystem is still open.

In twelve months, your organization will roll out AI guidelines. The question is whether you shaped those guidelines or they were handed to you by people who don't understand your work.
